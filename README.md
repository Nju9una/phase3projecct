## Task Management System

### Introduction

The Task Management System is a command-line application that enables users to manage tasks, names, and labels using a relational database. It provides a straightforward interface for performing CRUD operations on tasks, names, and labels while maintaining database integrity through cascading deletions.

# Features
Task Management: Add, view, update, and delete tasks.
Name Management: Add, view, update, and delete names associated with tasks.
Label Management: Add, view, update, and delete labels associated with tasks.
Automatic Priority Calculation: Prioritize tasks based on their due dates.
Database Integrity: Maintain database integrity using cascading deletions for tasks and labels.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
SQLAlchemy
SQLite (default database)
